Since securitizations may be structured in many \ndifferent ways, the capital treatment of a securitization exposure must be determined on the basis \nof its economic substance rather than its legal form. Similarly, OSFI will look to the economic \nsubstance of a transaction to determine whether it should be subject to the securitization \nframework for purposes of determining regulatory capital. Institutions are encouraged to consult \nwith OSFI when there is uncertainty about whether a given transaction should be considered a \nsecuritization. For example, transactions involving cash flows from real estate (e.g. rents) may be \nconsidered specialized lending exposures, if warranted.

Liability cash flows should \ncorrespond to IFRS fulfillment cash flows (incorporating risk adjustments but excluding \ncontractual service margins). Projected asset and liability cash flows (except for liability cash \nflows associated with participating, adjustable, and index-linked pass-through products) that are \ninterest sensitive should be changed to be consistent with the interest rate scenario. \n \nFor participating, adjustable, index-linked risk pass through (RPT) and non-interest sensitive \nproducts, the same liability cash flows are used for all interest scenarios. For participating \nproducts, restated dividend cash flows should be projected using the methodology described in \nsection 5.1.3.3, and all other cash flows should be projected based on fulfillment cash flows. \nAdjustments to cash flows should not be made for anticipated reductions or increases in \ndividends that may result from increases or decreases in interest rates under each scenario. A \nreduction in required capital for the potential risk-mitigating effect of dividend reductions is \ncalculated separately for participating and adjustable products (q.v. Chapter 9). \n \nThe treatment for specific asset and liability cash flows is described next. ",
