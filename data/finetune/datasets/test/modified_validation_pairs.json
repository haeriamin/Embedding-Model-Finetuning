A CCP becomes a counterparty to trades with market participants \nthrough novation, an open offer system, or another legally binding arrangement. for the \npurposes of the capital framework, a CCP is a financial institution.   \n\u2022 A  qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a \nCCP (including a license granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted \nby the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products  "

        "     \ntrade has a non-linear relationship with the underlying risk factor (which is the \ncase for options and collateralized debt obligation tranches). \n2) A  supervisory factor (SF)  is identified for each individual trade in the netting set. the \nsupervisory factor is the supervisory specified change in value of the underlying risk \nfactor on which the potential future exposure calculation is based, which has been \ncalibrated to take into account the volatility of underlying risk factors. \n3) the trades within each asset class are separated into supervisory specified hedging sets. \nthe purpose of the hedging sets is to group together trades within the netting set where \nlong and short positions should be permitted to offset each other in the calculation of the \npotential future exposure. \n4) aggregation formulas are applied to aggregate the effective notionals and supervisory \nfactors across all trades within each hedging set and finally at the asset-class level to give \nthe asset class level add-on. the method of aggregation varies between assets classes and \nfor credit, equity and commodity derivatives. it also involves the application of \nsupervisory correlation parameters to capture diversification of the trades and basis risk. \n [basel framework, CRE 52.30]  "

        "under what circumstances may a FRI cede 100% of its risks in a specific line of business? ",
        "  6   A FRI generally should not, in the normal course of its business, cede 100 per cent, or substantially all, of its\nrisks in the main areas in which it conducts business. absent extenuating circumstances (e.g., a troubled fri),\nsuch an arrangement could weaken the underwriting standards and discipline at the ceding FRI. A FRI may,\nhowever, occasionally cede a portion, or even 100 per cent, of a specific line of business or a particular type\nof risk that is ancillary to its core business to, for example, underwrite the business for purely marketing or\nrelationship purposes. cessions of existing lines of business at 100 per cent may, depending on the\ncircumstances, also be acceptable to OSFI.
