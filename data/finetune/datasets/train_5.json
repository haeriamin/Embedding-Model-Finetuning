Further, it notes that this assessment should consider \ninstitution-specific characteristics of systemic importance, such as size, inter-connectedness and \nsubstitutability, which are correlated with the systemic impact of failure. Accordingly, OSFI\u2019s \nassessment of domestic systemic importance for Canadian institutions considers a range of \nindicators such as asset size, intra-financial claims and liabilities, and an institution\u2019s roles in \ndomestic financial markets and in financial infrastructures. This section describes OSFI\u2019s \ninferences from various measures of systemic importance.  <br><br> <br><br>*Size*\n \n2. \nIn general, an institution\u2019s distress or failure is more likely to damage the Canadian \nfinancial system or economy if its activities comprise a large share of domestic banking activity. \nWhen Canadian institutions are compared according to their size as measured by total \nconsolidated assets, and by place of booking of assets, that is, according to whether the assets are \nbooked in Canada or abroad, the data show that: <br><br>\u2022 the largest six banks account for more than 90% total banking assets; <br><br>\u2022 the differences among the largest banks are smaller if only domestic assets are \nconsidered; and <br><br>\u2022 relative systemic importance declines rapidly after the top five banks and after the \nsixth bank.  <br><br> \n*Inter-connections*\n \n3. \nThe more inter-connected an institution is to other financial institutions, the greater is the \npotential for the failure of that institution to transmit problems throughout the financial system \nand to the broader economy. As a result, measurements of inter-connectedness also inform \ninstitutions\u2019 systemic importance. Comparing Canadian institutions according to measures of \nintra-financial assets (i.e. claims on other financial institutions) and intra-financial liabilities (i.e. \nobligations to other financial institutions) again points to the dominance of the largest Canadian \nbanks. The rank-ordering among these banks, however, depends on the specific inter-\nconnectedness measure under consideration.   <br><br> \n*Substitutability*\n \n4. \nThe systemic impact of an institution\u2019s distress or failure is greater the less easily it can \nbe replaced as both a market participant and a financial service provider. As a result, OSFI\u2019s \nidentification of D-SIBs also takes into account the types of roles that institutions play in \ndomestic financial markets and in domestic financial infrastructures, which inform views \nregarding substitutability. For example, this includes underwriter rankings in Canadian financial ",

The largest \nbanks are also the dominant participants in CDSX, the clearing and settlement system for \nsecurities transactions in Canada. Some large Canadian banks also play key roles as members of \nthe CLS Bank, the global institution that settles foreign exchange transactions between banks in \nCanadian dollars and other major currencies.41 For example, the Royal Bank of Canada and the \nCanadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are the key Canadian-dollar liquidity providers for \nsettling Canadian dollar foreign exchange transactions through the CLS network. <br><br> <br><br>5. \nA variety of additional information has been assessed and recurring themes across the \nrange of evidence are the following:  <br><br>\u2022 The five largest banks are by far the dominant banks in Canada, and consistently play \ncentral roles in a range of activities in the Canadian financial system; and   <br><br>\u2022 The rank-order importance of the largest banks, as well as the relative differences \nbetween them, varies somewhat according to the measure considered.   <br><br> \n6. \nThis suggests that there are strong grounds for treating these banks in the same way, \nrather than relying on arbitrary weights to develop a single index of systemic importance. \nFurther, distinguishing reliably between the adverse effects on the Canadian economy from \nindividual D-SIB failures is largely moot, given the difficulty of credibly differentiating between \nthe large adverse impacts on the Canadian economy from the failure of any one of the largest \nbanks. This also argues against making distinctions between identified Canadian D-SIBs to \nassign degrees of systemic importance.  <br><br> \n7. \nGiven these various considerations, the Canadian D-SIBs are judged to be Bank of \nMontreal, The Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of \nCanada, and The Toronto-Dominion Bank, without further distinction between them. National \nBank of Canada has also been designated as a D-SIB given its importance relative to other less \nprominent banks and in the interest of prudence given the inherent challenges in identifying \nahead of time which banks are likely to be systemic in times of stress. The designation of D-SIB \nstatus will be periodically reviewed and updated as needed.  \n \n***Higher Loss Absorbency Targets***\n \n8. \nThe goal of a higher loss absorbency target is to reduce further the probability of failure \nof a D-SIB relative to non-systemic institutions, reflecting the greater impact that a D-SIB failure \nmay have on the domestic financial system and the economy.

Examples of readily available close out prices include <br><br>98. \nInstitutions must mark-to-market as much as possible. The more prudent side of bid/offer \nshould be used unless the institution is a significant market maker in a particular position type \nand it can close out at mid-market. Institutions should maximise the use of relevant observable \ninputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs when estimating fair value using a valuation \ntechnique. However, observable inputs or transactions may not be relevant, such as in a forced \nliquidation or distressed sale, or transactions may not be observable, such as when markets are \ninactive. In such cases, the observable data should be considered, but may not be determinative. \n[Basel Framework, CAP50.5] <br><br>*Marking to model*<br><br>99. \nOnly where marking-to-market is not possible should institutions mark-to-model, but this \nmust be demonstrated to be prudent. Marking-to-model is defined as any valuation which has to \nbe benchmarked, extrapolated or otherwise calculated from a market input. When marking to \nmodel, an extra degree of conservatism is appropriate. OSFI will consider the following in \nassessing whether a mark-to-model valuation is prudent: <br><br>(1) Senior management should be aware of the elements of the trading book or other fair-\nvalued positions which are subject to mark to model and should understand the \nmateriality of the uncertainty this creates in the reporting of the risk/performance of the \nbusiness. <br><br>(2) Market inputs should be sourced, to the extent possible, in line with market prices (as \ndiscussed above). The appropriateness of the market inputs for the particular position \nbeing valued should be reviewed regularly. <br><br>(3) Where available, generally accepted valuation methodologies for particular products \nshould be used as far as possible. <br><br>(4) Where the model is developed by the institution itself, it should be based on appropriate \nassumptions, which have been assessed and challenged by suitably qualified parties \nindependent of the development process. The model should be developed or approved \nindependently of the front office. It should be independently tested. This includes \nvalidating the mathematics, the assumptions and the software implementation. <br><br>(5) There should be formal change control procedures in place and a secure copy of the \nmodel should be held and periodically used to check valuations. <br><br>(6) Risk management should be aware of the weaknesses of the models used and how best to \nreflect those in the valuation output. <br><br>(7) The model should be subject to periodic review to determine the accuracy of its \nperformance (e.g. assessing continued appropriateness of the assumptions, analysis of \nprofit and loss versus risk factors, comparison of actual close out values to model \noutputs).

Curvature risk is based on two \nstress scenarios involving an upward shock and a downward shock to each \nregulatory risk factor.  <br><br>(d) The above three risk measures specify risk weights to be applied to the regulatory \nrisk factor sensitivities. To calculate the overall capital requirement, the risk-\nweighted sensitivities are aggregated using specified correlation parameters to \nrecognize diversification benefits between risk factors. In order to address the risk \nthat correlations may increase or decrease in periods of financial stress, an \ninstitution must calculate three sensitivities-based method capital requirement \nvalues, based on three different scenarios on the specified values for the \ncorrelation parameters as set out in paragraphs 118 and 119.   <br><br>(2) The DRC requirement captures the jump-to-default risk for instruments subject to credit \nrisk as set out in paragraph 215.

Decomposition with a valuation model is defined as \nfollows: a single name equivalent constituent of a securitization (e.g. tranched position) is \nthe difference between the unconditional value of the securitization and the conditional \nvalue of the securitization assuming that the single name defaults, with zero recovery, \nwhere the value is determined by a valuation model.

That is, end-of-day trading positions are input into the risk \nmeasurement model, which assesses the possible change in the value of this static portfolio due \nto price and rate movements over the assumed holding period. [Basel Framework, MAR99.1] <br><br>408. \nWhile this is straightforward in theory, in practice it complicates the issue of backtesting. \nFor instance, it is often argued that neither expected shortfall nor value-at-risk measures can be \ncompared against actual trading outcomes, since the actual outcomes will reflect changes in \nportfolio composition during the holding period. According to this view, the inclusion of fee \nincome together with trading gains and losses resulting from changes in the composition of the \nportfolio should not be included in the definition of the trading outcome because they do not \nrelate to the risk inherent in the static portfolio that was assumed in constructing the value-at-risk \nmeasure. [Basel Framework, MAR99.2] <br><br>409. \nThis argument is persuasive with regard to the use of risk measures based on price shocks \ncalibrated to longer holding periods. That is, comparing the liquidity-adjusted time horizon 99th \npercentile risk measures from the internal models capital requirement with actual liquidity-\nadjusted time horizon trading outcomes would probably not be a meaningful exercise. In \nparticular, in any given multi-day period, significant changes in portfolio composition relative to \nthe initial positions are common at major trading institutions. For this reason, the backtesting \nframework described here involves the use of risk measures calibrated to a one-day holding \nperiod. Other than the restrictions mentioned in this paper, the test would be based on how \ninstitutions model risk internally.

On the other hand, including \nfee income may similarly distort the backtest, but in the other direction, since fee income often \nhas annuity-like characteristics.
