Subject to certain \nminimum conditions and disclosure requirements, institutions that have received OSFI approval \nto use the IRB approach may rely on their own internal estimates of risk components in \ndetermining the capital requirement for a given exposure. The risk components include measures \nof the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and \neffective maturity (M). In some cases, institutions may be required to use a supervisory value as \nopposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 30.1] \n \n3. \nThe IRB approach is based on measures of unexpected losses (UL) and expected losses \n(EL). The risk-weight functions, as outlined in section 5.3, produce capital requirements for the \nUL portion. Expected losses are treated separately, as outlined in section 5.7 and section 2.1.3.7 \nof Chapter 2.

For \nexample, there is a risk-weight function for corporate exposures and another one for qualifying \nrevolving retail exposures. The risk components, each of which is defined in section 5.4, serve as \ninputs to the risk-weight functions.

This type of \nfinancing is usually for large, complex and expensive installations that might include, for example, \npower plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and \ntelecommunications infrastructure. Project finance may take the form of financing of the \nconstruction of a new capital installation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or without \nimprovements. [Basel Framework, CRE 30.9] \n \n13. \nIn such transactions, the lender is usually paid solely or almost exclusively out of the money \ngenerated by the contracts for the facility\u2019s output, such as the electricity sold by a power plant. \nThe borrower is usually an SPE that is not permitted to perform any function other than developing, \nowning, and operating the installation. The consequence is that repayment depends primarily on \nthe project\u2019s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project\u2019s assets. In contrast, if repayment \nof the exposure depends primarily on a well-established, diversified, credit-worthy, contractually \nobligated end user for repayment, it is considered a secured exposure to that end-user.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 30.10] <br><br>*Object finance*<br><br>14. \nOF refers to a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, \nsatellites, railcars, and fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows \ngenerated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A \nprimary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third \nparties. In contrast, if the exposure is to a borrower whose financial condition and debt-servicing \ncapacity enables it to repay the debt without undue reliance on the specifically pledged assets, the \nexposure should be treated as a collateralized corporate exposure.  \n[Basel Framework, CRE 30.11] <br><br>*Commodities finance*<br><br>15. \nCF refers to structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables \nof exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will be ",

Introduction*<br><br>When taking collateral for a capital markets transaction, insurers should calculate an adjusted \nexposure amount to a counterparty for capital adequacy purposes in order to take account of the \neffects of that collateral. Using haircuts, insurers adjust both the amount of 1) the exposure to the \ncounterparty and 2) the value of any collateral received in support of the counterparty\u2019s \nobligations. Such adjustments are made to take into account possible future fluctuations in the \nvalue of the exposure or the collateral received71 resulting from market movements. This will \nproduce volatility-adjusted amounts for both the exposure and the collateral. Unless either side of \nthe transaction is in cash, the volatility-adjusted amount for the exposure will be higher than the \nexposure itself, and for the collateral it will be lower. Additionally, where the exposure and \ncollateral are held in different currencies, an additional downwards adjustment must be made to <br><br> \n70  However, the use of derivative instruments by a mutual fund solely to hedge investments listed as eligible <br><br>financial collateral shall not prevent units in that mutual fund from being recognized as eligible financial \ncollateral. \n71  The exposure amount may vary where, for example, securities are being lent.

These haircuts depend on the type \nof instrument and the type of transaction. The haircut amounts are then scaled using a square root \nof time formula depending on the frequency of remargining.

Calculation of exposure**<br><br>Credit exposure on bilaterally netted forwards, swaps, purchased options and similar derivatives \ntransactions is calculated as the sum of the net mark-to-market replacement cost, if positive, plus \na potential future credit exposure (an \u201cadd-on\u201d) based on the notional principal of the individual \nunderlying contracts. However, for purposes of calculating potential future credit exposure of \ncontracts subject to legally enforceable netting agreements in which notional principal is \nequivalent to cash flows, notional principal is defined as the net receipts falling due on each \nvalue date in each currency. \n \nThese contracts are treated as a single contract because offsetting contracts in the same currency \nmaturing on the same date will have lower replacement cost as well as lower potential future \ncredit exposure. For multilateral netting schemes, current exposure (i.e., replacement cost) is a \nfunction of the loss allocation rules of the clearing house. \n \nThe calculation of the gross add-ons is based on the legal cash flow obligations in all currencies. \nThis is calculated by netting all receivable and payable amounts in the same currency for each \nvalue date. The netted cash flow obligations are converted to the reporting currency using the \ncurrent forward rates for each value date. Once converted the amounts receivable for the value \ndate are added together and the gross add-on is calculated by multiplying the receivable amount \nby the appropriate add-on factor. \n \nThe potential future credit exposure for netted transactions (ANet) is equal to the sum of: ",
