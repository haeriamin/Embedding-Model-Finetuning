      "18 Timing impacts typically relate to the occurrence of operational risk events that result in the temporary distortion of an institution's financial accounts (e.g. revenue overstatement, accounting errors and mark-to-market errors). While these events do not represent a true financial impact on the institution, (net impact over time is zero), if the error continues across more than one financial accounting period, it may represent a material misrepresentation of the institution's financial statements.\n",
      "\n",
      "19 For example, when an institution refunds a client that was overbilled due to an operational failure, if the refund is provided in the same financial accounting period as the overbilling took place and thus no misrepresentation of the institution's financial statements occurs, there is no operational loss. However, if the refund occurs in a subsequent financial accounting period to the overbilling, it is considered a timing loss and should be included in the loss dataset if it exceeds the $30,000 minimum threshold (note that in this case the prior overbilling cannot be netted against the payment to the client as a recovery). [Basel Framework, OPE 25.26 FAQ #2]\n",

      "20 For timing losses that are accounting errors, institutions must determine the threshold for inclusion of these events in the loss data set. This threshold may be greater than $30,000 but must be below the level used by the institution's external auditor for determining the summary of material misstatements within the annual financial statement audit. Accounting errors do not include errors in the mark-to-market valuation of financial assets or timing errors that involve third parties (e.g. customer over-billing or underpayment to third parties), which must be included in the loss data set when the amount of the timing loss exceeds $30,000.\n",

The exclusion of internal loss events should be rare and supported by strong justification. In evaluating the relevance of operational loss events to the institution's risk profile, OSFI will consider whether the cause of the loss event could occur in other areas of the institution's operations. 22 Taking settled legal exposures and divested businesses as examples, OSFI would expect the organization's analysis to demonstrate that there is no similar or residual legal exposure and that the excluded loss experience has no relevance to other continuing activities or products.\n",

      "- 5. Category I Small and Medium Sized Deposit-Taking Institutions (SMSBs) with annual Adjusted Gross Income 4 greater than $1.5 billion must also use the Standardized Approach.\n",
      "- a) Category I SMSBs must calculate Adjusted Gross Income at each fiscal year-end.  If annual Adjusted Gross Income is greater than $1.5 billion, the institution must notify OSFI within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year, and use the Standardized Approach for operational risk in the following fiscal year.\n",
      "- b) Once a Category I institution crosses the $1.5 billion threshold, it must use the Standardized Approach for a minimum of two years. If, after two years, annual Adjusted Gross Income falls below $1.5 billion, the institution must notify OSFI and may revert to the Simplified Standardized Approach. 5\n",
      "- 6. Category I SMSBs with annual Adjusted Gross Income less than $1.5 billion may apply to OSFI to use the SA if they have a minimum of five years of high-quality loss data (i.e. data meeting the minimum standard for loss data collection as outlined in section 3.4.2). If approved, an institution is not permitted to set the Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM) to less than one until OSFI has determined that they have 10 years of high-quality loss data.\n",

      "- 11. Adjusted Gross Income should be adjusted to reflect acquired businesses and merged entities. Since the Adjusted Gross Income calculation is based on a rolling 12-quarter average, the most recent four quarters of Adjusted Gross Income for the acquired business or merged entity should be based on actual Adjusted Gross Income amounts reported by the acquired business or merged entity. If three years of historical financial data is not available for the acquired business or merged entity, the Adjusted Gross Income for the previous year may be used as a proxy for each of the other two years.\n",

When a charge-off (such as a settlement) eventually takes place later, only the difference between the initial provision and the charge-off (if any) should be added to the operational loss calculation. There should be no double counting of the same financial impacts in the calculation of operational losses. For example, if an institution takes a $1 million provision for a legal event in 2018, this should be included in the loss data for 2018.
